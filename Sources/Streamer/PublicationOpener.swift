///   - contentProtections: Opens DRM-protected publications.
///   - onCreatePublication: Called on every parsed `Publication.Builder`. It
///   can be used to modify the manifest, the root container or the list of

    /// The ``warnings`` logger can be used to observe non-fatal parsing

    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - asset: Asset providing access to the publication content.
    ///   - allowUserInteraction: Indicates whether the user can be prompted,
    ///     for example for its credentials.
    ///   - credentials: Credentials that content protections can use to
    ///     attempt to unlock a publication, for example a password.
    ///   - onCreatePublication: Transformation which will be applied on the
    ///     Publication Builder. It can be used to modify the manifest, the root
    ///     container or the list of service factories of the ``Publication``.
    ///   - warnings: Logger used to broadcast non-fatal parsing warnings.
    ///   - sender: Free object that can be used by reading apps to give some
    ///     UX context when presenting dialogs.
