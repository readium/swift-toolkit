///    to bitmaps.
///  - Others require to render the cover from a specific file format, e.g. PDF.
///
/// Furthermore, a reading app might want to use a custom strategy to choose the cover image, for
/// example by:
///
/// - iterating through the images collection for a publication parsed from an OPDS 2 feed
/// - generating a bitmap from scratch using the publication's title
/// - using a cover selected by the user
